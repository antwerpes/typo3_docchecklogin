========================
Extension Configuration
========================

For the Plugin to work properly you need to set up the extension configuration accordingly to your Login Licence and your needs.

To understand better which settings are usable by your Licence the settings are grouped by so. To know what the different Licences are standing for
please follow `this Page <https://more.doccheck.com/en/industry/login-licenses/>`__.

For the basic functionality, the free DocCheck Basic License should suffice.

If you dont have a Licence yet and are interested in buying one please contact `industry@doccheck.com`. They will also provide you with test licenses if needed.

Each Group in the Extension Configuration is based on the group before. The exception is the Crawling Feature that can be used even when you dont have a licence.

To access the extension configuration navigate in the typo3 backend to `Settings` ➞ `Extension Configuration` ➞ `typo3_DocChecklogin`.
