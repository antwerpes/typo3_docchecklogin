What does it do?
================

This extension integrates the popular DocCheck Login service with your TYPO3 website. It is currently maintained by antwerpes ag (a subsidiary of DocCheck AG).

*  It supports the **basic functionality** by logging in a dummy frontend user whenever someone has been authorized by DocCheck.
*  It supports the **UniqueKey-Feature** (optional, requires license Economy or higher), which allows you to identify returning visitors, by creating one frontend user per unique DocCheck user.
*  It supports the **DocCheck Routing-Feature** family, allowing you to configure different frontend user groups for different routing targets.
*  It supports the **DocCheck Personal-Feature** (optional, requires license Business and the UniqueKey-Feature), which will augment your unique DocCheck user by some person-related data – given, that the user agrees to this data transmission.
*  It supports the **DocCheck Crawling-Feature** to add your protected content in the DocCheck Search Engine index. With this powerful feature your valuable content will be searchable for healthcare professionals.
